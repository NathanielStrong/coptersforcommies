<p> Our Kamov Ka-25 (aka "Hormone") was developed from the Ka-20 which is a Soviet Navy helicopter and mostly replaced the Mil Mi-4 helicopter.</p>
<p> This weapon is uniquelly designed for the purpose of anti-submarine warfare. To do this it was two main rotors without a tail rotor however this enables it to be a much shorter helicopter.</p>
<p> The helicopter has 2 pilot seats, 12 passenger seats and room for many weapons. it is armed with two air-to-surface torpedoes and nuclear depth charges.</p>
