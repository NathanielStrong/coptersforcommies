<h1>Copters For Commies</h1>

<p>I started this website a awhile ago but never finished a lot of it. so I am hoping to get atleast partial credit for it. I made it all from the ground bare bones. I bought a website from EPIK and barebones debian 10 server that I linked to the website url. Then I installed nginx and certbot to give me the https url and then I got to work on the css and html. I started to slack here which is why functionality is not fully together.</p>
